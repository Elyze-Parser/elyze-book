Although Elyze is meant to be used with any kind of data slice. You'll probably want to use it with bytes.

There are some builtin components available out of the box to help you to parse strings or bytes data.

- [Tokens](bytes/tokens.html) : A collection of well-known patterns, already acceptable and peekable.
- [Delimited Groups](delimited_groups.html) : A delimited groups allow matching a range of bytes between delimiters.
